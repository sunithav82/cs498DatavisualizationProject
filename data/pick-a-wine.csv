The interesting smell of fermentation gives rise to strawberry and pink bubblegum scents. The gum persists on the palate, but in a pleasant, not overwhelming or sweet way, as does red licorice and watermelon.",Z Gris Estate Grown and Bottled Dry,90,16,Matt Kettmann,Zaca Mesa 2013 Z Gris Estate Grown and Bottled Dry RosÃ© (Santa Ynez Valley),RosÃ©,Zaca MesaUS,"Aromas suggest pink watermelon and bubble gum ester, with an intriguing twist of licorice.

The brilliant salmon-pink wine shows watermelon, light red cherry and a stony quality on the nose, while the grippy palate engages from the get-go with red plum, riverstone and gravel on the tip of the sip. Strawberry flavors carry through the strong acidity, and the finish is all about texture.",Z Gris,91,20,Matt Kettmann,Zaca Mesa 2016 Z Gris RosÃ© (Santa Ynez Valley),RosÃ©,Zaca MesaUS,"A pretty shade of pink bordering on mauve, this bottling shows bright watermelon, fresh strawberry and even red-plum aromas on the nose.

The nose shows exuberant black raspberry, scarlet rose petals and fresh lilacs against a backdrop of dewy thyme and oregano.
